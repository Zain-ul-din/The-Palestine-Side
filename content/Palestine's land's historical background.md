## Palestine History

Palestine, located in West Asia, holds historical significance as the birthplace of both Judaism and Christianity, which are part of the Abrahamic religions. Throughout its history, it has been ruled by various kingdoms and powers such as the Egyptians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, and Arabs.

From the 16th century until World War I, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, which was basically Muslim. During this period, the population was largely Muslim, and the Ottoman administration further reinforced Islamic influence in the region.

After the fall of the Ottoman Empire,The British government issued the [Balfour Declaration](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2018/11/2/more-than-a-century-on-the-balfour-declaration-explained) in 1917, expressing support for the establishment of a "national home for the jewish people" in Palestine. The declaration was named after Arthur Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary at the time.

### The Birth of the ["Zionist Movement"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism)

It is important to understand the Zionist movement in order to better grasp the Balfour Declaration and the purpose of establishing a national homeland for the Jewish people.

Zionism was a political and cultural movement that emerged in the late 19th century with the goal of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire. The movement sought to address the widespread anti-Semitism in Europe and promote Jewish self-determination.

There were several key purposes of zionism movement

- Addressing Anti-Semitism: In response to anti-Semitism and persecution faced by Jews in Europe and other parts of the world, Zionism provided a solution by advocating for a Jewish homeland where Jews could live securely.

- Negotiating with World Powers: Zionists engaged in diplomatic efforts to gain support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland, leading to events such as the Balfour Declaration in 1917, where the British government expressed support for a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine.

- Reconnecting with Historical Roots: Many Zionists believed in the historical and religious connection of Jews to the land of Israel, citing biblical and historical ties as a basis for the establishment of a Jewish homeland there. Some Jews believe that the Messiah will come when certain conditions, such as the ingathering of Jewish people in the land of Israel, are met.

    [12:2] I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name  great, so that you will be a blessing.
    [12:3] I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and   in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."*

    *[15:18] On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendants  I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
    [15:19] the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,

### [Anti-Zionism](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/resource/zionism/)

Anti-Zionism opposes the ideology and political movement of Zionism among Jews. Debate, criticism, and [opposition to Zionism](https://www.truetorahjews.org/mission) have persisted within Jewish thought throughout its history. Critics express their disapproval of Israeli state policies and may also voice moral, ethical, or religious concerns about the concept of a Jewish nation-state. According to a Rabbi *"Judaism is subservience to God, Zionism is nationalism"*

The fundamental distinction between 'Zionism' and 'Judaism' 

- Nature and Focus: Judaism is a monotheistic religious and cultural tradition followed by Jewish people. It encompasses a wide range of beliefs, practices, ethics, and religious rituals. Judaism is primarily a faith-based system focusing on the worship of one God and adherence to religious commandments.

- Believes: In Judaism, it is believed that God has prohibited the occupation of land and harming others in the pursuit of Jewish sovereignty. According to this faith, in the future, a supernatural transformation will occur, leading humanity to acknowledge one God. During this time, it is believed that God will personally rebuild the temple without any human intervention. Ultimately, the Messiah is expected to arrive as part of these beliefs.

    *2 In the last days the mountain of the LORD’s temple will be established as the highest of     themountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.
    3 Many peoples will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the templeof  the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.” The law willgo out   from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
    4 He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beattheir  swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up swordagainst     nation, nor will they train for war anymore.*
