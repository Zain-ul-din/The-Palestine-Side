### "Genocide" or "Ethnic Cleansing"

- **This war is not started yet.** The war has been ongoing since 1948, long before the creation of Hamas, with the Palestinian civilians including innocent children.

- Since World War II up to the present day, Israel has expelled [millions](https://imeu.org/article/the-nakba-and-palestine-refugees-imeu-questions-and-answers) of people from their land and occupied Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem illegitimately.

- **Israel often invokes the 'right to defend itself' argument, using it as a justification to target civilians, [their war is not with Hamas](https://imeu.org/article/fact-sheet-israels-history-of-spreading-disinformation). Their primary goal is to expel non-Jewish people from the Palestine land, leading them to attack civilian homes, schools, and [hospitals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmYN2-5-nSI) (including ambulances).**

- **Under the pretext of security**, Israel is engaging in war crimes, such as depriving civilians of essential resources like electricity, water, and food, as well as blocking humanitarian aid. Additionally, they are employing airstrikes and using [White Phosphorus](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/12/israel-white-phosphorus-used-gaza-lebanon) in densely populated areas which is illegal in international law.

### "Human Shield"

- **Israel is employing Palestinians, [including children](https://imemc.org/article/58197/), as [human shields](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/al-jazeera-world/2015/8/12/gaza-human-shields), committing an act of war by endangering these individuals.** 

- This conflict is not just targeted at Hamas; it affects the entire Palestinian population. Israel puts Palestinian lives at risk by compelling them to stay in or near homes that are used as military positions.

- Many pro-Israel individuals claim, "Hamas is using human shields" But, they don't have any evidence. **Several reports,  including one titled [Operation “Cast Lead”: 22 days of death and destruction](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/015/2009/en/), indicate that there is no proof of 'human shielding' from the Palestinian side or Hamas.**
