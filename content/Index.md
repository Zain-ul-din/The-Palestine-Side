### Gaza Strip

- Gaza is situated between Israel to the north and east, Egypt to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. during 1948 war approximately 250,000 Palestinians driven out of their homes. israel denied them their right of return to their homes afterward. **Currently, nearly 70% of the population in Gaza comprises refugees from the 1948 war.** Gaza is known for having the *"second-highest proportion of people [aged 0 to 14](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1206479861/israel-gaza-hamas-children-population-war-palestinians) globally."* This region, often cited as one of the most [densely populated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/07/14/gaza-city-is-being-hit-by-missile-strikes-this-is-how-densely-populated-it-is/) populated areas on the planet, spans 41 kilometers (25 miles) in length and 6 to 12 kilometers (3.7 to 7.5 miles) in width, covering a total area of 365 square kilometers. It is home to approximately 2 million people.

- In 1948, following the Arab-Israeli war, Gaza came under Egyptian administration, and a significant population of Palestinian refugees found refuge in the region after being forced out of their homes. In 1956, the [Suez Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis) occurred, during which Israel, along with the United Kingdom and France, invaded Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula after Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal. The conflict concluded under international pressure in 1957, and Gaza continued to be under Egyptian administration. At the conclusion of the conflict, over a thousand individuals from Gaza lost their lives.

- In the 1967 war, Israel gained control over Gaza and maintained occupation until 2005. Similar to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israel established Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. By 2005, around 7,000 Israeli settlers resided in 16 settlements there. 

- In 2005, Israeli settlers and troops withdrew from the Gaza Strip under international pressure. However, Israel continued its military occupation by exerting control externally and enforcing a land, sea, and air blockade after the 2006 Palestinian legislative election. The [UN Special Rapporteur](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2020/07/israels-collective-punishment-palestinians-illegal-and-affront-justice-un?LangID=E&NewsID=26111) on the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967 has condemned Israel's persistent blockade of the Gaza Strip as an unlawful form of collective punishment.

### "Human Rights"

- In 2005, Israel said it wasn't in charge of Gaza anymore. But many human rights groups and global organizations disagreed. They argued that Israel still had a lot of control over Gaza, whether its military was inside or around the borders. According to [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2004/10/28/israel-disengagement-will-not-end-gaza-occupation), Israel continued to have power over the area.

- Due to [Israel's blockade of Gaza](https://imeu.org/article/putting-palestinians-on-a-diet-israels-siege-blockade-of-gaza), Life for Palestinians there became really hard. **According to the [UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs](https://www.ochaopt.org/page/gaza-strip-critical-humanitarian-indicators), Israel delayed or said no to 37% of requests for Palestinians to leave for medical reasons. Palestinians had only 80% of the minimum water recommended by WHO. Many Palestinians bought lower-quality food because of food insecurity. They had electricity for only 13 hours a day. 9,000 Palestinians who lost their homes in previous Israeli attacks still need help.** The Israeli government's policies caused this humanitarian crisis. A government adviser even said they wanted to *"put the Palestinians on a diet."*

- israel has significantly restricted the movement of Palestinians and goods in and out of Gaza. Students in Gaza are unable to travel to universities in the West Bank, which offer unique fields of study not available locally. Essential materials like steel and cement, crucial for construction and rebuilding homes destroyed in recent and past Israeli military attacks, are strictly prohibited. 

- Additionally, **items essential for daily life, including food items, sanitary products, school supplies, fuel, agricultural supplies, and other everyday items, are also limited to some extent.** The restrictions imposed by Israel have created significant challenges for the people of Gaza in various aspects of their daily lives.

### West Bank

### "Genocide" or "Ethnic Cleansing"

- **This war is not started yet.** The war has been ongoing since 1948, long before the creation of Hamas, with the Palestinian civilians including innocent children.

- Since World War II up to the present day, Israel has expelled [millions](https://imeu.org/article/the-nakba-and-palestine-refugees-imeu-questions-and-answers) of people from their land and occupied Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem illegitimately.

- **Israel often invokes the 'right to defend itself' argument, using it as a justification to target civilians, [their war is not with Hamas](https://imeu.org/article/fact-sheet-israels-history-of-spreading-disinformation). Their primary goal is to expel non-Jewish people from the Palestine land, leading them to attack civilian homes, schools, and [hospitals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmYN2-5-nSI) (including ambulances).**

- **Under the pretext of security**, Israel is engaging in war crimes, such as depriving civilians of essential resources like electricity, water, and food, as well as blocking humanitarian aid. Additionally, they are employing airstrikes and using [White Phosphorus](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/12/israel-white-phosphorus-used-gaza-lebanon) in densely populated areas which is illegal in international law.

### Israel Attack

### "Self Defense"

- <pending...>

- Israel is not a blameless entity being attacked and safeguarding itself, as it presents itself in the [global media](https://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnists/2023/10/973351/who-has-right-self-defence-occupier-or-occupied). It is a colonial, settler-based apartheid system formed on the remains of Palestine, resulting from the displacement and forced removal of the Palestinian people after their [catastrophe (al-Nakba)](https://imeu.org/article/quick-facts-the-palestinian-nakba) in 1948.

### "Human Shield"

- **Israel is employing Palestinians, [including children](https://imemc.org/article/58197/), as [human shields](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/al-jazeera-world/2015/8/12/gaza-human-shields), committing an act of war by endangering these individuals.** 

- This conflict is not just targeted at Hamas; it affects the entire Palestinian population. Israel puts Palestinian lives at risk by compelling them to stay in or near homes that are used as military positions.

- Many pro-Israel individuals claim, "Hamas is using human shields" But, they don't have any evidence. **Several reports,  including one titled [Operation “Cast Lead”: 22 days of death and destruction](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/015/2009/en/), indicate that there is no proof of 'human shielding' from the Palestinian side or Hamas.**
