## The History

Palestine, located in West Asia, holds historical significance as the birthplace of both Judaism and Christianity, which are part of the Abrahamic religions. Throughout its history, it has been ruled by various kingdoms and powers such as the Egyptians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, and Arabs.

From the 16th century until World War I, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, which was basically Muslim. During this period, the population was largely Muslim, and the Ottoman administration further reinforced Islamic influence in the region.

After the fall of the Ottoman Empire,The British government issued the [Balfour Declaration](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2018/11/2/more-than-a-century-on-the-balfour-declaration-explained) in 1917, expressing support for the establishment of a "national home for the jewish people" in Palestine. The declaration was named after Arthur Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary at the time.

### The Birth of the ["Zionist Movement"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism)

It is important to understand the Zionist movement in order to better grasp the Balfour Declaration and the purpose of establishing a national homeland for the Jewish people.

Zionism was a political and cultural movement that emerged in the late 19th century with the goal of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire. The movement sought to address the widespread anti-Semitism in Europe and promote Jewish self-determination.

There were several key purposes of zionism movement

- Addressing Anti-Semitism: In response to anti-Semitism and persecution faced by Jews in Europe and other parts of the world, Zionism provided a solution by advocating for a Jewish homeland where Jews could live securely.

- Negotiating with World Powers: Zionists engaged in diplomatic efforts to gain support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland, leading to events such as the Balfour Declaration in 1917, where the British government expressed support for a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine.

- Reconnecting with Historical Roots: Many Zionists believed in the historical and religious connection of Jews to the land of Israel, citing biblical and historical ties as a basis for the establishment of a Jewish homeland there. Some Jews believe that the Messiah will come when certain conditions, such as the ingathering of Jewish people in the land of Israel, are met.

    [12:2] I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name  great, so that you will be a blessing.

    [15:19] the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
    [15:20] the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,

### [Anti-Zionism](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/resource/zionism/)

Anti-Zionism opposes the ideology and political movement of Zionism among Jews. Debate, criticism, and [opposition to Zionism](https://www.truetorahjews.org/mission) have persisted within Jewish thought throughout its history. Critics express their disapproval of Israeli state policies and may also voice moral, ethical, or religious concerns about the concept of a Jewish nation-state. According to a Rabbi *"Judaism is subservience to God, Zionism is nationalism"*

The fundamental distinction between 'Zionism' and 'Judaism' 

- Nature and Focus: Judaism is a monotheistic religious and cultural tradition followed by Jewish people. It encompasses a wide range of beliefs, practices, ethics, and religious rituals. Judaism is primarily a faith-based system focusing on the worship of one God and adherence to religious commandments.

- Believes: In Judaism, it is believed that God has prohibited the occupation of land and harming others in the pursuit of Jewish sovereignty. According to this faith, in the future, a supernatural transformation will occur, leading humanity to acknowledge one God. During this time, it is believed that God will personally rebuild the temple without any human intervention. Ultimately, the Messiah is expected to arrive as part of these beliefs.

    -- The book of Isaiah (2:2 - 2:4):

    *2 In the last days the mountain of the LORD’s temple will be established as the highest of     the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.
    3 Many peoples will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the temple of  the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.” The law will go out  from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
    4 He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their  swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against     nation, nor will they train for war anymore.*

### British Promises and "Balfour Declaration"

In addition to the Balfour Declaration, there were other agreements and promises made by the British and their allies during World War I that had significant implications for the Middle East, including Palestine. 

1. [Sykes-Picot Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement) (1916): This was a secret agreement between the United Kingdom and France, with the assent of the Russian Empire, defining their respective spheres of influence and control in the Middle East after the expected fall of the Ottoman Empire. The agreement proposed dividing the region into areas of British and French control, with Palestine being under international administration. 

1. [McMahon-Hussein Correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence) (1915-1916): Letters exchanged between Sir Henry McMahon, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, and Sharif Hussein of Mecca, a leader of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. In these letters, the British government appeared to promise support for Arab independence in exchange for Arab assistance against the Ottomans.

In 1917, the Balfour Declaration declared British support for a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine. The declaration was made in a letter written by Britain's then-Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour, to Baron Rothschild, a leader of the British Zionist movement. The letter was endorsed by Britain's then-Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who became a Zionist in 1915.
The letter stated the British would *“use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object”*. For Zionists, this was a clear victory.

The key figure behind the declaration was Arthur James Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary at the time. The proposal was influenced by several factors:
- Strategic Interests: Britain was engaged in World War I and was looking to gain support from various groups and nations. The British government believed that issuing a declaration in favor of a Jewish homeland in Palestine could garner support from Jewish communities in Russia and the United States. Additionally, Britain hoped to gain favor with influential Jewish individuals who had political and financial power.

- Pressure from Zionist Leaders: Chaim Weizmann, a prominent Zionist leader and later the first President of Israel, was influential in lobbying the British government for support. Weizmann's scientific contributions to the war effort (he developed a process for producing acetone, important for manufacturing explosives) also earned him favor within the British government.

- Political Considerations: The declaration was issued in part to counterbalance the influence of Germany in the Middle East. By supporting Jewish aspirations, Britain aimed to gain favor with Jewish communities and potential allies in the region.

- Biblical and Historical Connections: Some British politicians and intellectuals were influenced by religious and historical connections to the land of Israel. They saw supporting Jewish settlement in Palestine as fulfilling biblical prophecies and historical ties, reinforcing the idea of a Jewish homeland in the region.

- Post-War Settlement Plans: As the war progressed and it became evident that the Ottoman Empire would be defeated, discussions about the post-war settlement included considerations for the future of territories like Palestine. The Balfour Declaration was seen as a step toward shaping the post-war order in the Middle East.
